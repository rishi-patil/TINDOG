# TINDOG
 Tindog is a fictional website that parodies the popular dating app Tinder, but instead of connecting people, it is designed to connect dog owners with other dog owners for socializing and potential dog playdates.

As a frontend website, Tindog is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with an intuitive interface that allows users to easily create profiles for their dogs, browse profiles of other dogs in their area, and connect with other dog owners.
